        # Rewrite the URI that we are going to send to the upstream server.
        #
        # We strip the route part and we get the rest of the path from the incoming request. For example, for a
        # back end defined like so...
        #
        # - Origin: http://my-service.svc.local:8080/endpoint/
        # - Route: /api/my-service/endpoint
        #
        # ... and a request sent to "/api/my-service/endpoint/resource/subresource", we strip the route prefix from
        # the request and capture the rest of the path, "/resource/subresource", to append it to the origin when
        # sending it to the upstream service. Therefore, Nginx, after authenticating the request, would end up
        # sending a request to "http://my-service.svc.local:8080/endpoint/resource/subresource".
        #
        # The reason why this is not done with a regex location instead is because when we have back ends defined
        # which have overlapping URLs, Nginx just returns on the first matched regex location. Therefore, with the
        # following defined locations...
        #
        # - location ~ /api/base
        # - location ~ /api/base/path-a/
        # - location ~ /api/base/path-a/subpath-a
        #
        # ... and a request sent to "/api/base/path-a/subpath-a/subsubpath-a", Nginx would match the first regex
        # location. The only reason we had regex locations in the past was to be able to remove the route prefix
        # from the requests and append the rest of it to the origin for the "proxy_pass" directive, because no one
        # was really using regex locations for anything else. And we can achieve the same thing by rewriting the
        # URI before passing it to "proxy_pass".
        #
        # The reason to prepend the "$upstream" variable is because if we have the following location...
        #
        # - location /api/test
        #
        # ... and a request is sent to "/api/test" without anything else, the capture group will be empty and then
        # Nginx complains with a "the rewritten URI has zero length" error. Prepending the "$upstream" variable
        # ensures that the rewritten URI will always have, at least, the upstream's URL and therefore the rewrite
        # will never be empty.
